## OAuth Provider Name 
GitHub

### Research Conducted By: Benjamin Clark, Trae Bennett, Jessica Walters and Josh Nebe

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 10, except the the report, which is a 5.
#### General Comments

This is a full stack application, utilizing a Mongo database and an API key, kindly provided by Github.
Overall working with the Github API key was simple and well documented. The steps to get the required
information was also incredibly straight forward.


#### Pros
* Well Documented
* Not a lot of required fields
* instructions were broken up into reasonable steps.

#### Cons
* The initial search for the API key/tokens is a little tedious
* Github app's are pushed at the user more than the API key

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Sound. Well written and highly detailed.

#### Systems Requirements
N/A

#### Ramp-Up Projections
Depending on whether or not there is a starter code provided.. It is doubtful that it would take very long to 
build something with the given information

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
I assume this is quite a popular use of OAuth, mainly because it is utilizing Github. Something that most 
developers utilize.
